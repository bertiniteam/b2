Bertini 2.0:  The redevelopment of Bertini in C++.

The solution of arbitrary polynomial systems is an area of active research, and has many applications in math, science and engineering.  This program, Bertini 2, builds on the success of the first Bertini program, and seeks to eventually replace it entirely, as a powerful numerical engine.

The theoretical basis for the solution of polynomials with Bertini is "homotopy continuation", the act of "continuing" from one system into another through a "homotopy", as depicted in the below diagram.
