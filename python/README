As a user, skip to step 2.  as a developer, to compile this project, you need to

1) Regenerate the configure script, and some other m4 macros, etc, so that the build system is complete.  This requires the autotools, modern versions.  The command for this is

autoreconf -vfi

The -vfi flags are for (v)erbose, (f)orce, and (i)nstall.  If this step fails, you almost certainly have outdated autotools software, most namely automake, autoconf, and libtool.  Update your tools as necessary.

On Linux machines, you may have to run the command

libttoolize

in order to get autoreconf to work.

--------------

As a user, or maintainer, engage in the standard build process for any software built using the autotools.

2) ./configure (with your options)

3) make

Then, if you want to, you can run the test programs.  So far, there is one: b2_class_test.  It is built using the Boost.UnitTest library, and can produce a variety of output files, and be run in a variety of modes.  These options are not documented here.

-------------

notes:

If you add files to the project, or wish to add a compiled program, etc, you modify the b2/core/Makefile.am, and a b2/core/path/to/Makemodule.am file, or possibly create a Makemodule.am file at the correct location.  If you need help with this, please contact Dani Brake brakeda@uwec.edu

Please do not commit autotools-built files to the repository, including the configure script, any file in the created b2/core/config/ folder, or the others.  There is a chance you may have to add a m4 macro or something, and this is ok.  Do what you need, but commit only the source files, not generated files.

Please maintain this file by editing it as necessary.
